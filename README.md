# The Recursive Republic

The Recursive Republic (abbreviation **TRR**) is an advancement of Platos Republic designed for efficient governance of modern large scale civilisations. It is a means to combat [bureaucratic explosion](#Bureaucratic-Explosion) and [the illusion of the democracy](#The-Illusion-of-The-Democracy).

## The Principles of The Recursive Republic

1. The separation of Church and State
2. Consolidation of Power
3. Auto-emergent Systems

## The Separation of Church and State

### The Church
The Church is the community of people involved in the sacred expression of life. The Church has no authority, meaning there are no individuals in power that act as arbitrators of a higher power. Each individual is regarded as the ultimate arbitrator of their own divine purpose.

This is in opposition to the modern meaning of the word Church, where the church is a political organization pretending to arbitrate the will and word of God, while the sacred expression of life is defiled. Injunctions are placed upon followers to control their narrative. Meaningless religious rituals replace their true origins. It makes spiritual life into an absurd theater to further those in positions of power. 

### The State
The state is a nation or territory considered as an organized political community under one government. The role of the state is to enable and protect the expression of free life.

### Political Representation
The role of political representatives is to speak and act on behalf of the people in foreign matters.

### Arbitrators of Law
The arbitrators of law are people who are elected to judge in conflicts between individuals and groups of individuals. Judges investigate the factual circumstances of a case and negotiate an agreement between the parties or deliver a verdict. 

### Police
The role of police is to uphold social order in society.

### The Role of Separation
The separation of Church and State is the notion that the state is not intended to interfere with the expression of free life. The purpose of the state is to provide a system for the effective rule and working of complex human societies while individual lifes are regarded as sacred and absolutely free. It is not desirable to interfere in the lifes of free human beings, or the word free is taken in vain. The state requires some level of dutiful participation from citizens, without which a state cannot exist. Dutiful participation is only possible when the people are in agreement with the function of the state.

Separation is necessary between political representatives, arbitrators of law, and police. Each require their own democratic process. One class does not rule over another. They must be democratically and functionally independent. Democratic independence means the people vote for officials of each class. Functional independence means the organization and financing is independent between the classes. 

## Consolidation of Power
Consolidation of power means to gather the power of individuals into a whole that is more powerful than the individuals working alone. Consolidation of power does not mean to place unproportional amounts of power into the hands of few while individual power suffers. Ideally, every individual is as powerful and autonomous as their own capacity while the whole is more powerful than the sum of the individuals. 

If individual autonomy is lacking, the whole is weakened because the weak become a liability. If some individuals have unproportionally higher autonomy than others the whole is weakened for the same reason. 

When power is consolidated it is important to design a system that maximizes individual autonomy in order to boost morale. Individuals who participate freely and willingly are more likely to succeed in their endeavors. 

## Auto-emergent Systems
An auto emergent system is a system that has no initial design, except a process that brings forth an ever changing structure. This process is based on individual choice. 

For a system to be trustworthy, individuals must have the choice on who is their representative in different matters. Be it politicians, arbitrators of law, police or something else. Some representative positions are foreseen and some might be unforseen. 

Individuals can also choose to represent themselves. To act on their on behalf in any and all matters. 

The fundamental principle of TRR, recursiveness, is to enable detailed individual choice that propagates to the whole without the individual having to consider and know all aspects of complex society. The individual has the choice to vote in all and any aspect of governance, or to delegate his choice to a trusted party.

The ones who choose to not delegate are automatically candidates for leadership. They are selected leaders by the ones who delegate their voting power to them. The ones with most delegates are the selected leaders.

The process of voting can range from instantly and continuously to periodically. The method depends on the tools available. If modern tools like electronic devices and networks are available, voting can be instant and continous. Matters of leadership and decisions can be settled swiftly in a fast paced environment. 

Compared to current political processes that are slow moving, lack insight and transparency, TRR offers a system that outperforms the Republic by a large order of magnitude. The Republic was never intended for the globalized electro-mechanical age.

### Leader Election
The criteria for legitimate leadership: 
* He is chosen by the people
* He has the will and capacity to lead
* His leadship is selfless and dutiful
* He is the one who strives for the highest moral and philosophical virtue

These qualities can never be guaranteed since it is possible to decieve people that one is virtuos while the opposite is the case. A leader will be a mirror of the people, meaning people get the leaders they deserve. Good leadership requires good people.

### Bureaucratic Explosion

The term bureaucratic explosion refers to the phenomenon of a growing bureaucracy where more and more resources are used to uphold the system rather than free human life. Bureaucratic explosion is destined to fail since the people daily engage in meaningless tasks that do nothing to support human life. Instead the bureacracy works to ensure the ongoing illusory needs of the bureacracy.

The myth of Sisyphus is a symbolic story that exemplifies this phenomenon. A man rolls a large rock up a hill only to see it roll down again too begin anew. A fools quest. A great deal of the daily work of people in modern society involves doing jobs that lack purpose. Modern theories of economics that analyze resource distribution makes axioms out of false beliefs (money, i.e. credit swap systems), which makes meaningless jobs look like productive life.

The bureaucracy streches farther than government jobs. Private companies work under the illusion that growth of labor and credit is a desired phenomenon. The reality is that people want to minimize unnecessary work in order to free their time. The political and economic consensus is that this kind of growth is desired, while individual growth is sacrificed and opposed in an effort to protect bureaucratic explosion. 

This is ultimately an effect of power consolidation to a small group of people who are resistant to share power and motivate it by deluding themselves that their wealth of power is earned because of arbitrary rules of ownership and credit swap systems. For example, the owners of publicly traded companies recieve dividents indefinetly and are in control of capital that they did nothing to earn other than power mongering. 

Credit swap systems (aka money), stand at the root of this phenomenon. J.J.R. Tolkien, the author of the world renowned novel "The Lord of The Rings" is the symbolic narrative of the effects of credit swap systems, bureaucratic explosion, and the violence that ensues when people oppose it. It is the story of good vs evil, light against darkness, life vs death, told using a mythological fantasy where the living try to destroy the credit swap system (the ring) while the dead desperately tries to regain control by persecution and violence.

### The Illusion of The Democracy

The word democracy, meaning people rule (greek: demos, kratos), is a system that enables free people to rule their nation or state by means of voting for public officials and joint matters. Democracy is believed to originate from ancient Greece but the fundamental principle of it has natural origins.

In modern society the word democracy is used– or misused –to describe totalitarian regimes that control most aspects of the individual life while the people vote for parties that adhere to totalitarian rule. The totalitarian rulers appoint judges, jurys and executioners without the involvement of the people. Propaganda is used to convince the public that the nation is democratic. There is an inverse relationship between the frequency of the use of the word democracy, and the lack thereof. The more the proponents of totalitarianism use the word, the higher the lack of individual autonomy and rule.

The psychological basis is that people tend to talk about the things that are lacking in life in an effort to decieve oneself and others that the opposite of what is the case is the truth (aka denial). In reality, if something is working well, there is no need to mention it.

The same principle holds true for nations that talk about the independece of legal systems, humanitarian superpowers, freedom, and borders. The more these matters are mentioned, the more the evidence of the lack thereof. 

Individuals fail to see the real driving force behind these phenomenon due to trauma, mass media propaganda, and the illusion that systems can be stable. When the curtain falls, the reality becomes painfully evident. The emergence of public mass media, the internet, combats these effort. For this reason the internet is under government siege where unconvinient truths are censcored from the public eye. The public partly knows, but lacks the will, conviction, and power to do anything about the problem.
