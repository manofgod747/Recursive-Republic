# The Recursive Republic

The Recursive Republic (**TRR**) is a advancement of Platos Republic designed for modern large scale civilisations. It is a means to combat bureaucratic explosion and the illusion of the democracy.

## The Principles of The Recursive Republic

1. The separation of Church and State
2. Consolidation of power
3. Auto-emergent systems

### The Church
The Church is the community of people involved in the sacred expression of life. The Church has no authority, meaning there are no individuals in power that act as arbitrators of a higher purpose. Each individual is regarded as the ultimate arbitrator of their divine existence.

### The State
The state is a nation or territory considered as an organized political community under one government. The role of the state is to enable efficient expression of free life.

### The illusion of the Democracy

The word democracy, meaning people in power, is a system that enables free people to rule their nation or state by means of voting for public officials and joint matters. Democracy is believed to originate from ancient Greece but the fundamental principle of it has unknown origins.

In modern society the word democracy is used– or misused –to describe totalitarian regimes that control most aspects of the individual life while the people vote for parties that adhere to totalitarian rule. Fear propaganda is used to convince the public that the nation is democratic. There is an inverse relationship between the frequency of use of the word democracy, and the lack thereof. The more the proponents of totalitarianism use the word, the higher the lack of individual autonomy and rule.

The psychologically basis is that people tend to talk alot about the things that are missing in life, in an effort to decieve oneself and others that the opposite of what is the case is the truth.

The same principle hold for nations that talk about the independece of legal system, being a humanitarian power, freedom and borders. The more these matters are talked about, the more the evidence of the lack thereof.
