# The Recursive Republic

The Recursive Republic (**TRR**) is a advancement of Platos Republic designed for modern large scale civilisations. It is a means to combat bureaucratic explosion and the illusion of the democracy.

## The Principles of The Recursive Republic

1. The separation of Church and State
2. Consolidation of power
3. Auto-emergent systems

### The Church
The Church is the community of people involved in the sacred expression of life. The Church has no authority, meaning there are no individuals in power that act as arbitrators of a higher purpose. Each individual is regarded as the ultimate arbitrator of their divine purpose.

This is in opposition to the modern meaning of the word Church, where the church is a political organization pretending to arbitrate the will and word of God, while the sacred expression of life is defiled. Injunctions are placed upon followers to control their narrative. Meaningless religious rituals replace their true origins. It makes spiritual life into an absurd theater to further those in positions of power. 

### The State
The state is a nation or territory considered as an organized political community under one government. The role of the state is to enable efficient expression of free life.

### Bureaucratic Explosion

The term bureaucratic explosion refers to the phenomenon of a growing bureaucracy where more and more resources are used to feed the system rather than free human life. Bureaucratic explosion is destined to fail since the people daily engage in meaningless tasks that do nothing to support human life. The myth of Sisyphus is a symbolic story that exemplifies this phenomenon. A man rolls a large rock up a hill only to see it roll down and begin again. A great deal of the daily work of people in modern society involves doing jobs that lack purpose. Modern theories of economics that analyse society makes axioms out of false beliefs (money, i.e. credit swap systems) which makes meaningless jobs look like productive life.

The bureaucracy streches farther than government jobs. Private companies work under the illusion that growth of labor and credit is a desired phenomenon. The reality is that people want to minimize unnecessary work in order to free their time. The political and economic consensus is that this kind of growth is desired, while individual growth is sacrificed and opposed in an effort to protect bureaucratic explosion. 

This is ultimately an effect of power consolidation to a small group of people who are resistant to share power and motivate it by deluding themselves that their wealth of power is earned because of arbitrary rules of ownership and credit swap systems. For example, the owners of publicly traded companies recieve dividents indefinetly and are in control of capital that they did nothing to earn other than power mongering. 

Money, or credit swap systems, stand at the root of this phenomenon. J.J.R. Tolkien, the author of the world famous novel "The Lord of The Rings" is the symbolic narrative of the effects of credit swap systems, bureaucratic explosion, and the violence that ensues when people oppose it. It is the story of good vs evil, light against darkness, life vs death, told using a mythological fantasy where the living try to destroy the credit swap system (the ring) while death desperately tries to regain control.

### The Illusion of The Democracy

The word democracy, meaning people in power, is a system that enables free people to rule their nation or state by means of voting for public officials and joint matters. Democracy is believed to originate from ancient Greece but the fundamental principle of it has unknown origins.

In modern society the word democracy is used– or misused –to describe totalitarian regimes that control most aspects of the individual life while the people vote for parties that adhere to totalitarian rule. Fear propaganda is used to convince the public that the nation is democratic. There is an inverse relationship between the frequency of the use of the word democracy, and the lack thereof. The more the proponents of totalitarianism use the word, the higher the lack of individual autonomy and rule.

The psychological basis is that people tend to talk about the things that are lacking in life in an effort to decieve oneself and others that the opposite of what is the case is the truth. In reality, if something is working well, there is no need to mention it.

The same principle hold true for nations that talk about the independece of legal system, humanitarian superpowers, freedom and borders. The more these matters are mentioned, the more the evidence of the lack thereof. 

Individuals fail to see the real driving force behind these phenomenon due to mass media propaganda and the illusion that systems can be stable. When the curtain falls, the reality becomes painfully evident. The emergence of public mass media, the internet, combats these effort. For this reason the internet is under government siege where unconvinient truths are censcored from the public eye. The public partly knows, but lacks the will, conviction and power to do anything about the problem.
